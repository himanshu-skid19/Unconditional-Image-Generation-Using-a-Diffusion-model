# Unconditional Image Generation with Diffusion Models

This project demonstrates the capabilities of a simple diffusion model, developed from scratch and trained on a dataset of flowers, to generate novel images. To begin experimenting with this application, follow the instructions below:

### Installation and Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure that you have the necessary libraries by executing the following command:
    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Launch the Application:**
    Start the application by running:
    ```python
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

### Navigating the Application

**Starting the Application:**
Upon launching, you'll encounter a user-friendly interface. There's a prominent button labeled "Generate New Images." Clicking this will instruct the model to produce approximately 60 new images. 

**Inference Time:**
Please note that generating these images can take between 3 to 5 minutes, so a bit of patience is needed during this process.
